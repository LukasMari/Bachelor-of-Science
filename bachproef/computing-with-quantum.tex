\label{ch:computing-with-quantum}

Once you start looking into quantum theory and everything it could possibly do for your scientific project, you would find yourself in one of the deepest rabbit holes you could ever possibly find. The true value of quantum research is how we can actually use it for real-life solutions. One could easily imagine that being able to simulate an exact medicine within a couple of days instead of the many months it takes at the moment, would save a numerous amount of lives. So keeping this same train of thought throughout, it is of great importance that we actually focus our attention on what current developments could possibly mean for existing projects and research.

\subsection{Quantum computing and traditional computing}

QC is and will never be the sole solution to a problem. This new form of computing is made to be an addition to points where classical computing fails, e.g. searching through an extremely large dataset without having a clear index within a polynomial time frame such as in \textcite{Terhal1998}. QC also has its limits it takes a lot longer to actually set up your computation than it would take on a regular machine, but it could be able to solve a couple of non polynomial problems we are currently facing in computer science like factorization. Some problems have been left NP-complete even with quantum like this paper has tried, \textcite{Wang2007}. 

Classical computing is still great at organising stuff and performing parallel actions on your device, but with the help of QC we would be able to shift the heavy long term calculations over to devices especially made for long term and hard calculations like a quantum processor. Calculating a machine learning model \textcite{Schuld2014} or performing an accurate simulation of a new medicine could be exponentially reduced in time, which would in turn return the value of these calculations to the business side in a much faster way and with that would be even more valuable to them if the information is gathered in a proper time frame. \autocite{Schuld2015} \autocite{Troyer2005}

\subsection{Quantum computing and the mainframe}

First of all we need to clarify what a mainframe is and what its main use is in our current business environments. A mainframe is a type of supercomputer that is different from other supercomputers because it is not specialised in solving 1 really hard problem, like simulations or factorisation, it is specialised to have the highest possible throughput for smaller calculations. The mainframe is widely used within the banking, production and logistical sector as it offers the most reliable way of managing your data that is generated by a certain business practice. To clarify let us look at an example where a mainframe computer like the IBM Z15 shines. When millions of users throughout the world want to buy their flight tickets towards France around the end of April, a huge bottleneck is created at the end point of the booking system of the particular airport. A mainframe handles these types of atomic transactions to make sure every single booking will come through with the correct data and if the data is corrupted along the way, the mainframe is able to spot out these irregularities and discard this data so that the user received a proper notification as soon as possible. So look at a mainframe computer as a really good processor of input and output.

IBM has released the new mainframe in 2019, Z15, with a broad future perspective, because as one of the top researchers in quantum technology they have a clear image of how a quantum computer could influence themselves and others within their sector.
They are emphasising on 2 very different aspects to make sure their devices are the most likely to take the biggest market share, modernisation and security. 
With modernisation IBM is trying the incorporate the mainframe in as much areas as possible to keep on attracting new developers so that their devices don't fall behind. And with this modernisation a lot of opportunities are opening up to connect different departments such as quantum research with data engineering etc. 

Also emphasising on creating new security measures which focusses more on digital signing than the current RSA factorisation algorithm could secure the mainframe security status indefinitely. Quantum would in the future indeed be able to break these RSA based algorithms and that is why data-security has become such a high importance area at the moment for everyone in computer science.

So now that you are able to view what role the mainframe plays, we can more clearly look at how quantum computers could offer major benefits as a complementary service for solving the harder problems just like a super computer works with the mainframe in much the same way. Nowadays all the data generated from the billions of transactions from the mainframe are preserved so that afterwards a supercomputer would be able to process all this information inside a reasonable time frame to get as most as possible business value out of it. If the quantum computer would be able to help process this data exponentially faster, the business value of this data would also exponentially increase.



\subsection{Quantum computing and Machine Learning}

Another area where QC could majorly impact is the area of Machine Learning \textbf{(ML)}. At this moment machine learning is running into a bottleneck where the amount of data has become so intense that ordinary classical computing is not able to process the data in time so that its value can be exploited to its maximum potential. QC could help with this issue in a couple of major aspects, like data model training and data capturing. This would greatly improve the impact of ML on the business side, because the relay of the captured information through the models could indeed be shortened in exponential ways in a purely theoretical way as of now. \autocite{Biamonte2017}

At this moment research is becoming quite prevalent in ML with a combination of QC-technology. Qiskit has also seen this opportunity opening up and they too try and attract businesses with these advantages. We are able to enhance supervised learning algorithms as well as unsupervised learning, with time series or without. Algorithms such as linear regression, k-means clustering and even neural networks can be enhanced during its training phases with QC. Because due to superposition and entanglement, these algorithms could train a model theoretically through one loop instead of having multiple epochs that contain a certain size batch, which obviously speeds up the models that require a large amount of data to become valuable.

So the utilisation of QC with ML would not aid the accuracy of ML in the short run, but the time frame of processing the complete dataset could be exponentially decreased. Meaning if the relay of critical changes in the flow of data becomes quicker, business will become more valuable in the same manner.

For the practical part of this paper, we will show of how the utilisation of quantum computers can aid ML in promising ways. This does not mean that QC does not have a long way to go, to become superior than classical computing. We will compare the results between classical computing, simulation of quantum computing and the real executions om IBMQ-devices.

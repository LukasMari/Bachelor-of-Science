Why did I choose to explore the quantum realm without any prior knowledge/ education? Quantum computing is being transformed to a real buzzword much like data science was. The field has been opened up from just highly specialised academics to an open source community willing to teach outsiders the very basics.

Also the mere fact that the field of quantum computing is developing to a profitable and sustainable business so rapidly has astonished me from my very first contact with the environment.

 I would like to thank Frank Harkins from IBM for being available to have a chat about quantum computing and how it will influence our societies and even our very nature of problem-solving. 
 
 But most of all I would like to congratulate the research environment around quantum computing on how accepting and supportive they are for all interested parties. In the next decade quantum computing will only become more apparent and obvious to a point where quantum computing becomes an essential part of problem solving anything within a reasonable time scheme.
 
 So that is exactly why this paper will serve as a great starting tool for a computer scientist that is interested in the multiple ways quantum computers could influence the general sector.

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel quantum swarm evolutionary algorithm (QSE) is presented based on the quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QEA). A new definition of Q-bit expression called quantum angle is proposed, and an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to update the quantum angles automatically. The simulated results in solving 0-1 knapsack problem show that QSE is superior to traditional QEA. In addition, the comparison experiments show that QSE is better than many traditional heuristic algorithms, such as climb hill algorithm, simulation anneal algorithm and taboo search algorithm},

  abstract  = {It is well known that for certain tasks, quantum computing outperforms classical computing. A growing number of contributions try to use this advantage in order to improve or extend classical machine learning algorithms by methods of quantum information theory. This paper gives a brief introduction into quantum machine learning using the example of pattern classification. We introduce a quantum pattern classification algorithm that draws on Trugenberger's proposal for measuring the Hamming distance on a quantum computer [CA Trugenberger, Phys Rev Let 87, 2001] and discuss its advantages using handwritten digit recognition as from the MNIST database.},
